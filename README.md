# Evira, a discord bot using ChatGPT or a local LLM.

You can try it [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1175006774479290470&permissions=67584&scope=bot). Please note that this is using my own private LLM instance and is used as a beta-testing platform, so it may have issues such as NSFW or incorrect answers.

This is a discord bot that uses ChatGPT or a local LLM with a openai compatible API as a backend.

You can talk to the bot directly using a mention (`@Evira`), then using replies, a reply thread is a single discussion thread.

It is designed to reply mostly (but not exclusively) in pre-defined languages and on pre-defined topics. You can customize it's personality or add additional data in it's context.

It is still basic at the moment, but it should be working still. It still need more polish and features since it was made as a PoC for my private LLM instance.
